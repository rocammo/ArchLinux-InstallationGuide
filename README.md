## About

![archLinuxLogo](img/archLinuxLogo.png)

This repository is a guide for installing Arch Linux from the live system booted with the official installation image. 
> **Note:** I write this mainly for myself, as well as a guide especially for the Spanish-speaking community. In case you are English speaker or prefer to keep the language in English, just skip the steps relating to language settings.

## Tip (only for VirtualBox users)

If you're running Arch Linux inside VirtualBox, there's a tip to increase the maximum vram allowed (that's just 128MB to 256MB; not a big difference, I know, but it works). All you have to do is open a terminal and then, run the following command:

~~~
VBoxManage modifyvm {nameofthevm} --vram 256
~~~
